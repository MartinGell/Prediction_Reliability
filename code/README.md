# Introduction

Here you will find the code used for running all aspect of the analyses.

The loose scripts in this folder were used for predictions (`prediction_nestedCV.py`) and for collecting the results from hundereds of predictions into one table for plotting (starting with $datasate_name and followed by `_collect_predictions...py`)

<br />

The remainder of the code here has been split into folders:

1. sample - contains scripts to get various samples from the datasets used in the study.
2. reduce_reliability - contains scripts used to create less reliable simulated data.
3. func - contains some helpful functions for other python scripts to run.
4. plotting - contains the code used to create figures. The figures themeselves are also in the folder '/plots/Figures/'
